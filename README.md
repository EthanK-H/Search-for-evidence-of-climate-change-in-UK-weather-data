# Search-for-evidence-of-climate-change-in-UK-weather-data
This repository contains an analytical model designed to scrutinise Met Office weather data spanning from 1853 to 2022, aiming to uncover signs of climate change. It includes two distinct sections: traditional statistical analysis and machine learning. In the traditional statistical analysis section, we develop a predictive model for weather patterns and examine the significance of the weather data for the year 2022. In the machine learning section, we implement a simple classifier that categorises data into two groups: pre-1990 and post-1990. This categorisation is based on a predefined set of features, aimed at revealing any substantial shifts in weather patterns that could be indicative of climate change. This project serves as the foundation of my MSci Physics major project at Royal Holloway, University of London. It includes the original source code along with the final report detailing the findings and conclusions.
